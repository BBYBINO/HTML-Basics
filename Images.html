    <h1>Images</h1>
    
    <p>As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. Here you can see an example of the files for a website; all of the images are stored in a folder called <i>images</i>.</p>
        
    <p>To add an image into the page you need to use an <i>img</i>element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).</p>
        
        <img src="pictures/bear.jpg" alt="A lazy grizzly bear" title="A grizzly may chow down on 90 pounds (40 kilograms) of food each day." width="360" height="360" />
        
        <h1>Image Placement</h1>
        
    <p>Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Below is an example.</p>
        
    <img src="Pictures/squirrel.jpg" alt="squirrel" width="120" height="120" />
    <p>Squirrel is a term that most use to refer to a kind of familiar fluffy-tailed, tree-climbing rodent, or "tree squirrel". However tree squirrels are only a part of the true squirrel family, which also includes chipmunks, groundhogs and prairie dogs.</p>

        <h1>Aligning Images Horizontally</h1>
        
    <p>Use the <i>align</i>tribute to indicate where the image should be placed for the text to flow around. You can align left, right, middle, bottom and top.</p>
        
        <p><img src="Pictures/penguin.jpg" alt="Penguin" width="100" height="100" align="left"/>Penguins are flightless birds. â€“ While other birds have wings for flying, penguins have adapted flippers to help them swim in the water.</p>
